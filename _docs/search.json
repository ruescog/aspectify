AspectJ (used in Java), can sound familiar to the reader.\nIn order to bring this amazing and powerful functionality to Python (which, in addition, will allow us to add it dynamically instead of using a weaver –as it is done in Java–), we have defined Aspectify, a Python library to manage AOP."

In fact, an Aspect will group some functionalies. These, which will modify the natural behaviour of a method, are called Advices. - PointCut (when): a fragment of code where the Aspect is defined. Can be multiple PointCuts for each Aspect (indeed, it will). - Advice (when and what to do): The code fragment to execute when the PointCut occurs and the moment when the new behaviuor must occur. Originally, only three moments were defined (before, around –instead of– and after), but nowadays new moments are defined, such as “after throwing an exception” (after_throwing) or “after NOT throwing an exception” (after_returning)."

Furthermore, if other functions or library use this method, they will not use yours.\nHow can we solve it? Using AOP.\nDuring this introduction, we have seen the background concepts and how to install the Aspectify library. In the next section we will explain how to use it with a simple example."
