    "- `Advice` (_when and what to do_): The code fragment to execute when the `PointCut` occurs and the moment when the new behaviuor must occur. Originally, only three moments were defined (`before`, `around` --instead of-- and `after`), but nowadays new moments are defined, such as \"after throwing an exception\" (`after_throwing`) or \"after NOT throwing an exception\" (`after_returning`)."
