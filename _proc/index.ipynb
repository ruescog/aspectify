    "- `PointCut` (_when_): the time at which the new behaviuor must occur. Originally, only three points in time were defined (`before`, `around` and `after`), but nowadays new points in time are defined, such as \"after throwing an exception\".\n",
    "- `Advice` (_what to do_): as mentioned above, the code fragment to execute when the `PointCut` occurs."
